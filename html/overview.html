            This website is my own ecosystem, it has been built for both my own personal use and for anyone that is interested in gaining an insight into what shenanigans I get up to in my own time.
            Feel free to look at my favorite personal projects, scroll through my links or view my personal wiki; I develop quick pdfs giving general information about a topic to allow me to quickly retrieve the information I need.

            This website is currently under the first stages of development, if you have any ideas or would like to contact me you can message my discord: N3utra1#9690
